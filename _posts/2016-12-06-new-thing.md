summary: Site relaunch announcement
---

I've update the website with a new look and new content.

Last time I dug into the website code was around 2010, and it's been interesting
seeing how things have changed in html/css. I'll put more details up later when
I've got time to write it up.

Lots left to do on the site; pagination, post formatting, some illustrations
maybe? I might finish it all, if a website is ever really finished.

In the meantime I've posted some music playlist from last year. Enjoy
