title: "Shiny"
summary: How I built the website using Jekyll, Sass, CSS3, etc.
---

The never ending march of progress! It's been a bit over five years since I
tried build my last site (which ended up shelved until now). Looking just at the
little part of web tech I used, things have really moved on.

Last time I was doing this, Internet Explorer was still causing incompatibility
issues. Now, with the release of Edge and IE 11 being _mostly_ standards
compliant, most of those concerns (for html/css) have gone away. And when
something is causing a problem, even Internet Explorer has dev tools and an
inspector! After using Firebug for many years, the in-built dev tools have just
made it redundant.

I've also found some great resources which I either didn't exist in 2010, or I
just never knew about them. First is [Can I use][] which really helps determine
if a css feature you just found is universally accepted, a single-browser
novelty, or hot-new-thing noone has implemented. The second is [MDN][], an
invaluable reference and guide to html, css, and js. It's by Mozilla, but it
appears to be a good reference across browsers.

(If you're a cool kid, and use [ddg][], you can quickly search both, in your
address bar, by doing either `!caniuse css-thing` or `!mdn webthing`)

When I built the [first version][] of pddds, the way things were, I didn't get a
chance to really use some of the modern web things. Partly because were was
still patchy support, partly because I just didn't have the time. This version
has been different; from the outset I've been focusing on 

## Jekyll

[Jekyll][jekyll] wasn't one of the new things, I had used it on the first
version, but with the amount it seems to have changed since
2011, it feels like a very different tool.

When I used it last, it
was still a novel ruby project. Now it's really matured into a solid framework.
Looking through the
[contributions](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/graphs/contributors)
it looks like this all started happening in 2013 when
[parkr](https://github.com/parkr) took over the project. It seems more
streamlined, you can go from install to a blog in no
time. Things that I had previously thought of building plugins to do now seem
possible just using the vanilla tools, and that's not to say it's bloated.
Running through the docs

Instead of spending time setting up jekyll, I've been able to get right to
building the website.

## Sass

I don't remember if [sass][] was shipped with jekyll previously; I remember
reading about it, but it seemed like a hassle to set up with uncertain benefits.
It also seemed like a toss up between sass and [less][].

Well that all changed. Sass is shipped with jekyll, sass appears to be the
[better choice over less](https://css-tricks.com/sass-vs-less/),
and I'm sold on it just by the tools for managing colours.

Previously I'd
[used jekyll to define reusable
colours](https://github.com/m0tive/pddds.com/blob/1.0/_layouts/defaultcss.css#L13-L17),
which was _ok_, but was really just a hack. Now, using sass, I can do it in a
css-like way:

{% highlight sass %}
$purple: #8D205A;
$green:#5f9252;

$lightwood:#9E713A;
$darkwood:#7B5030;

$linkCol:$green;
$linkHoverCol:$purple;
$linkVistedCol:darken($linkCol, 20%);
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight sass %}
a {
    color: $linkCol;
    text-decoration:none;
    &:visited { color: $linkVistedCol; }
    &:hover {
        color: $linkHoverCol;
        text-decoration:underline;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

And then there are the mixins, which let you define reusable blocks or
functions. For example, for the shadowed line I have:

{% highlight sass %}
@mixin border-shadow($highlight, $shadow) {
    border-#{$highlight}: 1px solid $highlightCol;
    border-#{$shadow}: 1px solid $shadowCol;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Which you can then include, setting which border is the highlight and which is
the shadow:

{% highlight sass %}
hr {
    border: 0;
    height: 0;
    @include border-shadow(bottom, top);
}
{% endhighlight %}

There is [more in there](http://sass-lang.com/guide), but that's all I've really needed so far.

## Fonts

Web fonts (where you load the font from the server), as I remember them,
were some combination of flash and javascript
hacks. Things are pretty different now, although it still requires some
javascript superglue to load the fonts.

I found a nice, clean, open source font; [Fira](https://mozilla.github.io/Fira/)
by Mozilla. I use for all the headers on the site.

Now, the problem. Browsers support web fonts as part of the Css, but there
are some _issues_. The main being ["FOIT" (Flash of Invisible Text)](
https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/font-events.html). The browser won't render
your text until the font is loaded, so you really need _two_ fonts, and you need
to switch between them once the font has loaded. This is where I use
[Font Face Observer](https://fontfaceobserver.com/) to smooth over the cracks.

It's a bit rough, but this is how it looks in the html:

{% highlight html %}
<script type="text/javascript" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/js/fontfaceobserver.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
let font800 = new FontFaceObserver('Fira Sans', { weight: 800 });
let font700 = new FontFaceObserver('Fira Sans', { weight: 700 });
let font500 = new FontFaceObserver('Fira Sans', { weight: 500 });

Promise.all([font800.load(), font700.load(), font500.load()])
    .then( function(){
        document.documentElement.className += " fonts-loaded";
    });
</script>
{% endhighlight %}

Now, if you don't run with javascript it won't work (which makes me sad as a
NoScript user) but the fallback font is not _that_ different.

The main body just uses "traditional" fonts; specifying the already installed
font to use. Nothing new with this, except now there are reliable modern system
fonts. It's good enough for [Medium](https://medium.design/system-shock-6b1dc6d6596f),
why not me?

{% highlight css %}
body {
    font-family:
        -apple-system,
        BlinkMacSystemFont,
        "Segoe UI",
        "Roboto",
        "Helvetica Neue",
        sans-serif;
}
{% endhighlight %}

I think it looks nice.

## Responsive Layout

Leaving the best till last, I built the site "responsive first" or
whatever therm term is. Once I had the infrastructure down, and I'd played around with
the fonts, I started looking at how to build the site for mobile, tablet and
desktop.

I went into this area completely blind and, like many of the new web tech I've
learnt, was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was. There were a couple of
articles about using css [flex](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex),
but I was still mostly in the dark. The key was the MDN article
["Using CSS flexible boxes"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes)
and specifically the "Holy Grail Layout example", which had a clear clean
example of how to use flex with media queries (also completely new to me) to get
what I wanted.

With only a tiny bit of fighting with IE 11, the site worked on mobile and
desktop!

From there I could start _growing_ the website design.
